<h1>Scandit SDK 4.16</h1>
<h2>New Features/Performance Improvements</h2>
<ul>
<li>Improved speed and accuracy of barcode localization for all 1d and 2d symbologies. In addition to these symbology-independent improvements, 1d barcodes with a very large height to width aspect ratio are localized much more reliably. Moreover, the localization of MicroPDF417 codes has been improved as well. MicroPDF417 codes are used as part of GS1 composite codes A and B. As a result, these composite codes can now be scanned much more quickly.</li>
<li>Added support for two postal code symbologies: RM4SCC (Royal Mail 4 State Customer Code) and KIX (Klant Index).</li>
<li>Added a unified Xamarin API suitable to be used together with Xamarin Forms. By using this API, the same code can be used for platforms targeting iOS, Android.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Bug Fixes/Software Updates in Scandit SDK 4.16.1 (September 13th, 2016)</h2>
<h3>All SDKs</h3>
<ul>
<li>Accept Code39 inter symbol gaps that are up to 6 units wide.</li>
<li>Allow more than six codes per frame to be scanned.</li>
<li>Add support for scanning PDF417 and MicroPDF417 codes with the scan case (iOS, Phonegap iOS and Xamarin iOS).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Low-Level API/Linux</h3>
<ul>
<li>Add functionality to retrieve software license strings.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Android</h3>
<ul>
<li>Improve auto-focus performance for Moto G4 and Moto G4 plus.</li>
<li>Improve auto-focus performance for Galaxy Note 5.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Bug Fixes/Software Updates in Scandit SDK 4.16.0 (31st of August 2016)</h2>
<h3>All SDKs</h3>
<ul>

<li>Fixed partial code reads of blurry Code39 codes.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue that caused the new code rejection feature to fail when the session was cleared in the didScan callback.</li>
<li>Picker API's: PDF417 codes are now affected by the scanning area height, even if the scanning area height is very small. Previously, the scanning area height would only affect the area in which PDF417 codes are scanned if it was larger than 0.1. </li>
</ul>
<h3>Android</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fix auto-focus issues with Nexus 4. </li>
<li>Fix issue that caused the process frame listener not to be called under certain circumstances.</li>
<li>Fix a potential race condition in setting/reading the license key from different threads.</li>
</ul>
<h3>iOS</h3>

<li>Add <code>resumeScanningWithCompletionHandler:</code>, <code>pauseScanningWithCompletionHandler:</code> which accept a block to be invoked when the asynchronous operation finishes.</li>
<li>Use lightweight generics for all public methods and properties that use NSSet, NSDictionary and NSArray. For example, the newlyRecognizedCodes array of SBSScanSession is now marked to only contain SBSCode instances. This is a breaking change for Swift: Code that was previously checking the type no longer has to do so.</li>
<li>Cleanup layout of the extended sample app.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Linux</h3>
<ul>
<li>Enabled GPU support for Linux x86 and x86_64.</li>
<li>Added a function to get the currently enabled extensions for a particular symbology.</li>
</ul>

</ul>
<h3>Cordova/Phonegap</h3>
<ul>
<li>The barcode scanner plugin now includes a NSCameraUsageDescription. This is required when targeting iOS 10 and newer, as otherwise the camera requests fail at runtime.</li>
<li>Fix an issue in the extended sample app that caused the continue button to be shown when it shouldn't, e.g. when pressing the home tab button when already on the home tab.</li>
<li>Fix issue with turning on the torch programmatically before or immediately after calling startScanning.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Xamarin</h3>

<li>Handle an unexpected exception in the PDF417 error correction.</li>
<li>Fixed a rare out of bound read for certain 1d barcode symbologies.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Android</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fixed incorrect NEON detection for ARMv7 devices. This bug could lead to slightly lower frame rates on affected devices.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Bug Fixes/Software Updates in Scandit SDK 4.15.0 (July 28th, 2016)</h2>
<h3>All SDKs</h3>
<ul>
<li>Backwards incompatible change: The default value of code duplicate filter has been changed from 500ms to 0 (disabled). Code that relies on duplicate filtering will need to manually set the code duplicate filter. The default value of the barcode picker API's is not affected by this change and remains at 500ms.</li>
<li>Improved performance of blurry barcode decoder on x86 and x64-based devices such as some Android phones/tablets and Windows tablets.</li>
<li>Updated the GS1 DataBar AI parser to comply with the GS1 General Specification version 13. The AIs 337 (kilograms per square metre), 394 (discount of a coupon), 415 (GLN of invoicing party), 8012 (software version) and 8111 (loyalty points) have been added.</li>
<li>Add functionality to implement custom integrity checks for recognized codes. Codes that fail these additional integrity checks can be marked as rejected. As result, beeping, code highlighting as well as vibration are suppressed. This feature allows to implement custom checksums, or other types of integrity checks. </li>
<li>The new UPC-E extension 'remove_leading_upca_zero' allows to remove the leading zero if the UPC-E code is returned in its UPC-A representation using the extension 'return_as_upca'.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue with setDeviceName() that caused it to alternate between setting and unsetting the specified name.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue that could cause duplicate scan events to be transmitted by analytics.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Android</h3>
<ul>
<li>Add support for switching the UI style while the camera preview is running.</li>
<li>Instead of showing a dialog box when the camera can not be accessed, display the error message inside the BarcodePicker view itself.</li>
<li>The deprecated set1DScanningEnabled/set2DScanningEnabled no longer have any effect. A message is printed that they are not supposed to be used anymore.</li>
<li>Enable remove_leading_zero for UPCA by default when creating ScanSettings from a JSON dictionary. This fixes an inconsistency between the iOS and Android barcode picker implementation.</li>
<li>Disable torch for Samsung Galaxy Core 2 Duo which behaves in unpredictable ways and may lead to app freezes when turned on.</li>
<li>Added possibility to specify runnables to be executed when asynchronous operations such as starting the scanning finishes. This functionality behaves identical to the completionHandler support on iOS.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where the camera preview would not resize properly after rotating the device in non-fullscreen.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue that caused beeping to no longer work after creating tens of barcode pickers.</li>
<li>Fixed a potential issue when the camera preview is not able to start.</li>
</ul>
<h3>iOS</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fix issue with default values when initializing the scan settings from a dictionary. Previously it was not possible to disable the "remove_leading_zero" extension for UPCA codes. It would always be enabled.</li>
<li>Nul-bytes in SBSCode.data are now handled more gracefully. Previously, the string would get cut-off after the first nul-byte. While it's still recommended to use SBSCode.rawData for cases where nul-bytes are expected, this improves a few cases where nul-bytes are used to delimit UTF8-encoded data.</li>
<li>Improved angle tolerance of the Scan Case.</li>
<li>Improved focus performance on devices released prior to iPhone 6.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Phonegap</h3>
<ul>
<li>Add didStateChange event. This event is invoked whenever the state of the picker changes, e.g. when the picker state changes from active to stopped.</li>
<li>Fix issue that caused cancel events to be ignored for the full-screen picker when the cancel event was immediately sent after the picker has been started (affected only Android and Windows)</li>
<li>Fix issue that caused the didScan callback not to be blocking when a scan happened during a modal show animation (iOS only).</li>
<li>Support Android 6.0-style permission requests for accessing the camera. This makes it possible to use the barcode scanner plugin with a target SDK of 23. Previously, the target SDK had to be set to 22 and lower.</li>
<li>Added laser UI support for the Windows platform.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Xamarin</h3>
<ul>
<li>Remove support for building pre-unified iOS applications. Applications will have to switch to the unified iOS framework.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Linux</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fixed rowstride related bug for the SC_IMAGE_LAYOUT_YPCRCB_8U layout.</li>
<li>Added ARMv6l architecture build. Executing the SDK on the Raspberry Pi Zero is now possible.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Scandit SDK 4.14</h1>
<h2>New Features/Performance Improvements</h2>
<ul>
<li>Added support for the MicroPDF417 symbology. Performance will be improved in coming SDK versions. Reverse code scans are currently unsupported. </li>

<li>Make sure ScanSession.pauseScanning calls BarcodePicker.pauseScanning. Instead of calling pause/stop with cordova.exec, use the implementation offered by the JS BarcodePicker class. This makes sure the same logic is used when calling pauseScanning/stopScanning on the session and on the picker.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Xamarin</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fix an issue in the sample application that caused the preview to stay black. This was caused by a configuration problem in the sample application.</li>

<li>Fixed an issue in the SBSScanCase class that caused the scanner to not start in pause mode when using the designated initializer.</li>
<li>Improve scan performance for the scan case.</li>
<li>Do not export deprecated enum values to swift, since they cause issues with lldb when another project defines enum values of the same name.</li>
<li>Fix an issue that caused beeps to be cut off or stretched when using the volume button for triggering scans in the case API.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Phonegap</h3>
<ul>
<li>Android and iOS scan callbacks are now called synchronously from the engine, fixing any previously experienced double scans.</li>
<li>The startScanning(paused) and applyScanSettings(settings) functions have been fixed on Android (they were already working on iOS).</li>
<li>Documented how to use the Scandit SDK on the Telerik Platform.</li>
<li>Add rawData property to recognized codes which allows access to the data encoded in a barcode as an array of char codes.</li>
<li>Fix a bug in the parsing of the scanning hot spot on Android that caused x and y coordinates to be flipped.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Scandit SDK 4.13</h1>
<h2>New Features/Performance Improvements</h2>
<ul>
<li>

</li>
<li>
<p>Improved glare compensation for blurry 1D barcodes - the improved glare compensation for blurry barcodes makes our barcode scan engine more reliable in challenging conditions, where the images remains blurry because of a slow autofocus. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Added support for the Code25 symbology also known as 'Industrial 2 of 5', 'Standard 2 of 5' or 'Discrete 2 of 5'. The verification of the optional Mod10 checksum can be enabled to improve detection rates. With Code25, we added support for another rare 1D barcode symbology in addition to all common symbologies we've supporting for years.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>DataBar-14 and DataBar Expanded decoders are now significantly faster and more robust. The highlighting of Databar codes is also more precise. We would recommend that users of the previous generation of Scandit DataBar decoder upgrade to take advantage of the significant speed improvements (worst case frames with expanded Databar barcodes are now up to a factor 10 faster). </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dynamic ink spread compensation for Code39 codes. The ink spread compensation for Code39 barcodes has been further improved and now tolerates even more severe ink spread than before.</p>

<h1>Scandit SDK 4.10</h1>
<h2>New Features/Performance Improvements</h2>
<ul>
<li>Our new QR code decoder supports perspective distortions and a much wider range of rotations. The pitch and skew (yaw) tolerance increased to up to 70 degrees (for QR codes of version 1 (without 4th alignment pattern) and version 2 and higher (with 4th alignment pattern) - this is an increase of ~50% over SDK version 4.8. We also improved the maximum decode range and robustness of the QR decoder for a much improved QR code scanning user experience (see the video on our web page for details).</li>
<li>Scandit&#8217;s unique blurry decoding now decodes 1D barcodes before the autofocus has kicked in on additional popular Samsung devices such as the Galaxy S4 and S6. The impact is that the time to scan a barcode is drastically reduced on these devices as well. </li>
